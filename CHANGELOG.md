## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 867486e: The post publish pipeline now comes from `plugins/prc-shared/primitives/` instead of the `prc-post-publish-pipeline` plugin. These plugins no longer list that plugin in `Requires Plugins`. Publish, update, unpublish, and trash hooks fire the same way as before. The mu-plugin loader boots the pipeline once, so PRC Shared now runs it on the platform.
- 1d96db5: These plugins now require the renamed PRC Shared plugin, `prc-shared`, instead of `prc-scripts`.
- f8730c1: PRC Shared now loads the shared PRC primitives library for every PRC plugin when the plugins run outside PRC Platform. Plugins no longer bundle their own copy, so standalone installs need PRC Shared active.
